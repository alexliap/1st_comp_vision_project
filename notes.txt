Every image on the Cifar-10 dataset is represented by a row in each data file (row major order).
The first 1024(32x32) values represent the red channel, the next 1024 represent the green channel and the final 1024
represent the blue channel.
For each subset of 1024 values (red, green, blue) every i-th row of the image is represented by the i-th subset
of 32 values of the corresponding color channel (i.e. the first 32 entries of a row are the red channel values
of the first row of the image).
